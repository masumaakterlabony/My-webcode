      All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em>
      technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
      web.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
      and why you too should learn it.


    </p>
    <p><h1>What is HTML?</h1></p>
    <p>
      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web
      developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a
      programming language).
    </p>

    <p>
      HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
      paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
      HTML and render HTML code as websites.
    </p>

    <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The opening tag</li>
      <li>The closing tag</li>
      <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>You can learn more at</p>
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"> MDN WEB DOCS</a>

<p>Why should you learn html?</p>

<p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language
   of the web. Here are 5 of them:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
    <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix
     </li>
     <li>To build web applications</li>
     <li>To impress friends</li>
     <li>To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
   </ul>
<p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
